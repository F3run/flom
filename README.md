# flom
Docker container app that checks the waterlevel at Svartfoss. Use beautifull soup to find the water level (regex) and rPI gpio ports to move a servo based on the water level. Created it as a docker container for raspberry pi 3. Should work with other rPI versions as well, but it depends on the io pins.
